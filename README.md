# Practice making a grid in Javascript

This project is very basic but it was to practice how to make a grid using only Javascript.

I thought it would be a useful thing to practice as it would help with the creation of a Wordle clone. 

It proved to be a good exercise as I now feel more confident creating grids in Js.
